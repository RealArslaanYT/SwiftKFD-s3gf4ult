# SwiftKFD-s3gf4ult
Fork of [Lrdsnow's SwiftKFD](https://github.com/Lrdsnow/SwiftKFD) for [s3gf4ult jailbreak](https://github.com/RealArslaanYT/s3gf4ult)

Don't use this for any device other than A9 devices on 15.8.2 unless you have your own offsets, I recommend using the original SwiftKFD by Lrdsnow.

## How to use!
- import SwiftKFD and SwiftKFD_objc
- run `try? SmartKopen()` to kopen and `SmartKclose()` to kclose!
- you don't need to save the kfd object, it's abstracted away for you by the SwiftKFD api unless you want to use the direct SwiftKFD_objc api for low-level things
- Thats all! now you can do all your normal kfd stuff
- API is based on the kfd implementation in [Lrdsnow's fork of kfd](https://github.com/Lrdsnow/kfd)
